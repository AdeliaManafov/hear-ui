# Development override for docker-compose
#
# Purpose:
#  - Provide developer-friendly overrides for the main `docker-compose.yml`.
#  - This file is automatically picked up by `docker compose` when present
#    (no extra flags needed) and merges with the main compose file.
#
# Typical use in this project:
#  - Avoid binding the Postgres container to host port 5432 to prevent
#    conflicts with a host Postgres instance (`5433:5432` instead).
#  - Expose backend, frontend and adminer ports to the host for local
#    development and debugging.
#
# Use: keep this file for local development. It is NOT required for
# production and should not be used on production hosts.

    # Host port for Postgres can be overridden with POSTGRES_HOST_PORT
