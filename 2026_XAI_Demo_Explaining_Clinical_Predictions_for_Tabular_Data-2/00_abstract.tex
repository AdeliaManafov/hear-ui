\begin{abstract}
Explainable clinical outcome prediction on structured patient data is increasingly important for healthcare applications. 
\project is a modular framework that separates dataset preprocessing, model integration, and explanation generation, allowing 
researchers and clinicians to configure the system for different clinical tasks. Cochlear implant outcome prediction is presented 
as a demonstration, illustrating how domain-specific adapters and pluggable explanation components can be integrated without 
modifying the core infrastructure. While SHAP is used as an example explainability method, the framework supports alternative 
approaches including model-specific and model-agnostic techniques. The web-based interface provides interactive visualizations 
and allows clinician feedback, supporting both research and practical decision support.
