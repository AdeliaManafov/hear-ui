# Git attributes: Line ending and text handling for the entire repository.
# `* text=auto` automatically detects text files and normalizes line endings
# in the repository to LF. This reduces platform-dependent diff noise
# (e.g., CRLF vs. LF) and ensures consistent storage in the repository.
* text=auto

# For all shell scripts (*.sh), we enforce LF in the working copy.
# `*.sh text eol=lf` ensures that scripts under Unix/Linux/containers
# do not have CRLF extensions that could break executability/interpretation.
*.sh text eol=lf
