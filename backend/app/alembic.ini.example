# NOTE:
# This file is a local / developer copy of the Alembic configuration that
# was previously present at `backend/app/alembic.ini`.
#
# For containerized runs the project uses `backend/alembic.ini` (it is copied
# into the image and picked up by the prestart script). This example file is
# kept here as a reference for local development; to run alembic locally with
# this config use:
#
#   alembic -c backend/app/alembic.ini.example upgrade head
