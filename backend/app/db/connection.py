"""Compatibility shim.

This project has a package `app/db/` (directory) which contains `base.py` and
other DB helpers. Older code also placed a module `app/connection.py` which shadows
the package and breaks imports like `from app.db.base import SQLModel`.

To remain backward compatible without deleting files during runtime we load
the real package module `app/db/base.py` from its file location and inject it
into `sys.modules` as `app.db.base`. This allows Alembic and other code to
import `app.db.base` even when this shim module is present.
