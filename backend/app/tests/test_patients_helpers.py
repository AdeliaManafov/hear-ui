"""Tests for patient-related helper functions.

NOTE: The helper functions _normalize_input_features_for_model and
_get_missing_features_for_prediction were removed from patients.py
during refactoring. Patient data preprocessing is now handled by
the preprocessor module (app.core.preprocessor).

See test_preprocessor.py for preprocessing tests.
